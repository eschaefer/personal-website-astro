## Outline

- Introduction, why I did this.
  - I'm sensitive to sound.
  - Constant stream of sirens. Am I imagining it? What's the data saying?
    - Ambulances are typically 130 dB(A)
    - Police sirens are typically 120 dB(A)
    - European standard DIN 14610 tells that they must be min 110 dB(A) in cities.
    - Some samples of sirens from different countries https://www.hella.com/soe/en/News/Tone-sequence-of-the-RTK-audio-examples-4796/
      - Probably reliable, Hella makes great headlights. I bought some replacement ones for my old VW Golf.
  - Noise pollution. How much is it?
    - Open Data from [Berlin](https://gdi.berlin.de/viewer/main/?MAPS={%22center%22:%5B390022.4138428097,5820501.803771703%5D,%22zoom%22:5}&LAYERS=%5B{%22id%22:%22hintergrund_default_grau%22,%22visibility%22:true,%22transparency%22:0},{%22id%22:%22ua_stratlaerm_2022:bb_strasse_gesamt_den2022%22,%22visibility%22:true,%22transparency%22:0},{%22id%22:%22ua_stratlaerm_2022:da_autobahn2022%22,%22visibility%22:true,%22transparency%22:0},{%22id%22:%22ua_stratlaerm_2022:db_bundesstrasse2022%22,%22visibility%22:true,%22transparency%22:0},{%22id%22:%22ua_stratlaerm_2022:dc_sonstigestr2022%22,%22visibility%22:true,%22transparency%22:0},{%22id%22:%22ua_stratlaerm_2022:df_laermschutzeinrichtung2022%22,%22visibility%22:true,%22transparency%22:0}%5D) 
    - My 237 meter long section of Mehringdamm (data from 2019 unfortunately):
      - Average noise level: 75 dB(A)
      - 43140 vehicles pass by in a day.
        - If I would stretch these bumper to bumper, each one averaging 4.5 meters long, that's 194 kilometers of cars.
      - Cars: 34,880
      - Trucks: > 3.5 t (excluding buses): 1,370
      - Delivery vans: \<= 3.5 t: 5,520
      - Public buses: 50
      - Coaches: 120
      - Motorcycles: 1,170

- What's interesting here?
  - Data wise
  - Spectrum wise
  - Narrowing down which sirens are what? Fire/Police/Ambulance
